# About Wellington On a Beach (WOAB) üèñÔ∏è

üîó woab.devacademy.nz

Which beach in Wellington should you go to based on the conditions?

WOAB is the final project I shared with four other developers for Hihi 2022 cohort of Dev Academy Aotearoa. 

Additionally, I servered as our team's product owner to ensure that we all worked toward a cohesive vision for the MVP, helped prioritise workflow, and centered the user journey for our features. 

We had only 7-days to build a full stack web app and we're extremely pleased with what we produced! 

## TECH USED üë©üèΩ‚Äçüíª ##
- JavaScript
- React.js
- Redux
- Redux Thunk
- Material UI
- MetService API
- SQLite3
- Dokku (deployment)

## NEXT STEPS ‚ñ∂Ô∏è ##
- [ ] Adding full site reponsiveness

** TEAM HUMAN SKILLS

# Expectations and Agreements:

We agree that the expectation is the normal 9-5, but if team members want to do extra thats okay too but there is no pressure. 

We will also all try to come in on Sunday around 12pm.

If you are working outside those hours, keep team updated on what you are doing in the slack.

- What you are doing when you start - tickets/branches
- Where you got to when your finished - if there is a PR ready

Same break hours as dev academy:

- Wellbeing time Tues & Thurs (12-12.30pm)
- Lunch 12.30-2pm everyday

## Decisions:

Open communication. Express your feelings and be honest. NVC

During the planning phase, we will make decisions by unanimous/ majority vote.

Decision making while coding - shouldn‚Äôt be everyone. 

The person working on the feature makes coding decision, but let the  relevant lead know or add to PR comments. 

Key decisions and naming conventions to be added to the Github wiki

If you know something you are doing directly affects a task - add it to the impacted Kanban card.

## Getting Help:

Technical Conflicts - 20min max stuck on something - ask for help! From team member or facilitator.

Human Conflicts - speak to Joseph, patch or a facilitator for advice. 

Knowing your stress triggers, let‚Äôs remind each other to take breaks.

### Team members' stress profiles:

**Emelyn**:
I might look fine but I may be quite stressed deep down so it may be hard to spot. I could get snippy if I'm stressed, but I haven't done that too much here. That might be reserved for my partner :). I have anxiety and you may see me picking at my hair or nails and that may be an indicator that I'm stressed. I'm very verbal when I'm stressed and you might hear me talking to myself and getting frustrated. I appreciate it if someone reminds me to take a break or a check-in in those situations.

**Paola**:
I can be very stressed and people often won't see it. I have learned how to hid my stress due to my previous jobs in healthcare where you had to prevent showing emotion (or at least appear happy for your sick patients). Want to get better at expressing my emotions when I'm stressed. 

**Allie**:
I can get quite frustrated if I'm stressed. It's best for me to take a break. That's one reason why I haven't done so much study. I've been quite stressed over dev academy stuff and I need to step away when I'm feeling that way. Will be good to take breaks and for team members to notice and ask me to take a break.

**Kelsey**:
If I'm really stressed, I do tend to get short with people which I know is not very nice. I might also just be frustrated. You might see me with headphones on trying to shut everything out as a coping mechanism. I don't want to be disturbed in those moments because I'm trying to block the sound out to reduce the stress. I do like to talk about things but I know that can stress people out. I like a good vent session.

**Alyssa**:
I am very vocal and wear my stress profile on my sleeve. If I'm stressed, I'm probably showing it. I can overdo this and it can negatively impact the team if I have gone too far with my vocal venting/stressing. I don't tend to get angry or short with people, but sometimes I can if I'm really stressed. In times when I'm stressed, I can also be hyperfocussed due to ADHD, so it's good if someone can pull me away 1:1 to chat, vent, go for a walk, get some water.

## Other:

Everyone be aware of the vibe in team - remind each other to have fun.

If you‚Äôre struggling with your task speak with the facilitators to get some support. If it‚Äôs clarification on the task speak with a team lead.

Once a day - get out of the office together - break or coffee.

Stuff quiz same time every day - 3pm

Regular check-in in the morning - 9.15am (after mindfulness)

Drinks with code is okay with the team
