          We all know that you can't beat Wellington on a good day. This app is
          designed to help the user figure out which Wellington beach is the
          best one to go to when the sun is shining...even when it's windy!. The
          app provides the user with a global Wellington weather statistics
          using MetService data and more specific statistics per beach. The app
          can also filter beaches based on what they can provide such as whether
          a beach is good to see sunset or other features.{' '}
